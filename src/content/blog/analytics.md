Redesigning a B2B analytics platform is a complex journey that requires balancing user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. Our team started by conducting in-depth user research to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

We collaborated closely with stakeholders and end-users, iterating on wireframes and prototypes. The new design focused on clarity, actionable insights, and a modern visual language. We also improved performance and accessibility across the platform.

The results were clear: user engagement increased by 25%, and task completion rates improved by 40%. This project reinforced the value of a user-centered approach and cross-functional teamwork.
